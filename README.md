Project Motivation
For this project we were interested in predicting customer churn for a fictional music streaming company: Sparkify.

The project involved:

Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes
File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook and html file of the notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

Medium Blog Post
Since I have started the Data Science Course as an educational measure from the employer, we were not allowed to publish under our name. There the blog post is uploaded here. 

Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
I'd like to acknowledge Udacity for the project idea and workspace.
