- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

Project Motivation
The motivation of this project was to understand what how churning users differ from loyal users in order to be able to predict which users might be churning.

The project involved:

Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of a full dataset available (12GB)
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and what features are useful for predicting churn
Feature Engineering to create features that will be used in the modelling process
Modelling using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes
File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook and html file of the notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.
