Sparkify: "Tackling User Churn with Trees"

**Installations:**
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

**Project Motivation**
The aim of the project was to understand how users that churned differed from loyal users in a subscription-based streaming service environment.
In order to predict which users are likely to churn, all of the facets of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree were used.

In this execution we worked with the smaller subset (128MB) of the full dataset (12GB) for practicality reasons (reduced processing time).
First, the data was loaded and cleaned.
Then the interesting features for churn prediction were identified via Exploratory Data Analysis.
After that, the feature engineering was conducted to create features that will be used in the modelling process.
Subsequently, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, Naive Bayes were carried out on a 60/20/20 train, test, validation split.
